    "# 🏡 Linear Regression Architecture Workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the **Linear Regression Architecture Workshop**.  \n",
    "This workshop is designed for college-level students learning both:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Univariate Linear Regression** – a foundational algorithm in Machine Learning, focusing on predicting continuous values from a single feature.  \n",
    "2. **Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)** – design patterns and architectural considerations that make machine learning experiments reproducible, scalable, and production-ready.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use **real-world housing price data** from **California (USA)** and **Ontario (Canada)** as our case study.  \n",
    "The goal is to not only understand how Linear Regression works, but also how to **design and implement a machine learning project** from sourcing data → building models → structuring code → preparing for deployment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The workshop will be completed in **two 2-hour sessions**, with **homework assignments** to be completed before each class.  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Before Session 1: Data Sourcing\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first task is to collect **housing price data** for California and Ontario.  \n",
    "You must experiment with **at least three different types of data sources**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CSV Files**  \n",
    "   - Find open housing datasets (e.g., Kaggle, UCI ML Repository, government portals).  \n",
    "   - Example: [California Housing Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html#california-housing-dataset).  \n",
    "   - Save datasets in `data/raw/` folder.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Web Services (APIs)**  \n",
    "   - Explore free APIs offering housing, rental, or real-estate data.  \n",
    "   - Example APIs:  \n",
    "     - [Zillow (unofficial APIs exist, check docs)]  \n",
    "     - [Realtor.ca data endpoints]  \n",
    "     - [City of Toronto Open Data API](https://open.toronto.ca/)  \n",
    "     - [California State Open Data Portal](https://data.ca.gov/).  \n",
    "   - Use Python packages like `requests` or `httpx` to fetch data.  \n",
    "   - Save results into structured JSON or convert to DataFrames.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Relational Databases**  \n",
    "   - Connect to a **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** demo database.  \n",
    "   - Option 1: Use hosted databases with sample housing/economic data.  \n",
    "   - Option 2: Load CSVs into a local database (e.g., PostgreSQL with `psql` or SQLite for portability).  \n",
    "   - Connect from Python using `sqlalchemy` or `psycopg2`.  \n",
    "   - Run SQL queries to filter/select data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "💡 **Deliverable before Session 1**:  \n",
    "- A Jupyter Notebook that loads housing price data from all three sources (CSV, API, Database) and explores it with basic descriptive statistics and plots.  \n",
